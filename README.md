# Clinical Data Extraction with OpenAI's Open-Weight Models

Testing local healthcare AI data extraction using OpenAI's gpt-oss models.

## Overview

This repository contains synthetic data for testing clinical information extraction as demonstrated in this blog post: [Medium Article Link](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/i-ran-openais-new-open-model-on-my-laptop-to-extract-medical-data-here-s-what-happened-aeb6acddfede)

## Contents

- `data/synthetic_notes.csv` - 10 synthetic discharge summaries with realistic clinical complexity

## Synthetic Clinical Notes

All clinical notes in this repository are **completely synthetic** and created for demonstration purposes. No real patient data was used. These examples are designed to showcase clinical AI extraction capabilities while maintaining complete privacy.

The synthetic notes include realistic:
- Patient demographics and contact information
- Medical histories and clinical terminology
- Medication regimens and dosing
- Lab values and diagnostic procedures
- Provider information and follow-up scheduling

## Note on Privacy

This approach demonstrates healthcare AI that preserves patient privacy by running entirely on local hardware. No patient information ever leaves your environment.

## Contributing

This is an early exploration. More comprehensive evaluation and additional clinical use cases coming soon.
